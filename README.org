* Random Forests

This repository holds the a Random Forests implementation in python, applying the ensemble learning method and stratified cross-validation. This implementation works for both nimerical and categorical attributes. The work is part of the Machine Learning course on the Informatics Institute, at UFRGS.

The objective is to provide an original implementation and to analyze the impact that some parameters have upon the model performance. More specifically, we aim to optimize the number of trees on the ensemble method.

* Required libraries
You might need to install some libraries on your system:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install numpy
#+END_SRC

* Usage and input files
To run the application you must inform the input file that contains the dataset and an additional file containing the type (numerical or categorical) of each attribute:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
python3 main.py <file_name> <attribute_type_file>
#+END_SRC

The file containing the attributes types can be a simple text file and  must present a line for each attribute and its type in the following manner:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
<attribute name> <numerical/categorica>
#+END_SRC
